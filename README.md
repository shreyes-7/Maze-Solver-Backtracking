Maze Solver using Backtracking Algorithm

This repository contains C++ code for solving mazes using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes input in the form of a maze represented by a 2D matrix where '1' represents a path and '0' represents a wall. It then finds a path from the starting point to the end point in the maze, if such a path exists.

Features

- Takes input of a maze represented as a 2D matrix where '1' represents a path and '0' represents a wall.
- Uses a backtracking algorithm to find a path from the starting point to the end point.
- Outputs the solved maze with the path followed marked.

Input Format

The input matrix represents the maze where '1' indicates a path and '0' indicates a blocked path.

Output Format

The program will output the solved maze if a path exists, with '1' indicating the path followed by the solver.
